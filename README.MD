# FullStack FrontEnd

🌍 Motivation

I started out in tech as a frontend developer, mainly turning designs into websites. Over time, I got curious about how things work behind the scenes, so I began learning backend development. Fast forward to now—I’m a full-stack developer who can handle everything from system design to building the full application.

Along the way, I realized that frontend and backend go hand in hand. Frontend is all about user experience and design, while backend handles data and business logic. Learning both has helped me see the bigger picture and make smarter decisions when building apps.

As I dove into backend topics like databases, APIs, and server deployment, I gained a deeper understanding of how systems fit together—and how to better work with other developers too.

With modern web development moving toward frontend-backend separation, the demand for full-stack developers has really grown. Companies want people who can do both, and more developers are aiming to become full-stack.

✨ What is Trip?

<b>Trip</b>—a full-stack project to help developers understand how the frontend and backend work together. Through this project, I’m sharing what I’ve learned, in hopes it helps others grow into confident full-stack developers too.

Key features include:

    • 🔐 User authentication (Sign up & Login)
    • 📝 Creating and editing travel logs
    • 📖 Browsing trip history
    • 📄 Generating shareable PDF reports for each trip
    • 🔧 More features coming soon: search, social sharing, advanced filters…
